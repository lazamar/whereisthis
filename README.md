# Where Is It?

A machine learning classifier to identify likely places where a picture was taken

This project is based on the paper [PlaNet - Photo Geolocation with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45488) by Tobias Weyand, Ilya Kostrikov and James Philbin

We use J. Randall Hunt's implementation in [WhereML](https://github.com/ranman/WhereML)
