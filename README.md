# Where Is It?

A machine learning classifier to identify likely places where a picture was taken

This project is based on the paper [PlaNet - Photo Geolocation with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45488) by Tobias Weyand, Ilya Kostrikov and James Philbin

We use J. Randall Hunt's implementation in [WhereML](https://github.com/ranman/WhereML)

# Running

The project needs some model files that cannot be added to source control because of GitHub's limit on committed file sizes. These files can be found [here](https://github.com/multimedia-berkeley/tutorials/blob/master/README.md) or together with the code in the zipped releases of this project.
